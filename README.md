 

ðŸŒ¿   Hi!..This is Gul Inan.   
- I am a PhD level statistician and working as a faculty member 
at Department of Mathematics, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey. 
- I am currently interested in:
   - Analysis of high-dimensional image data and 
   - Data science tools in digital humanites, and studying in these areas with my students.
- In Spring21, I am teaching an undergraduate level "Introduction to Data Science" course with `R` and using `GitHub classroom` for my class. Here is
the GitHub organization of our course https://github.com/MAT381E. 

- Note 1: I am looking for international/national PhD level collaborators to work on mathematical aspects of deep learning algorithms.
- Note 2: I am not accepting undergraduate students this semester any more, and any openings for undegraduate level will be announced around mid-September. Please note that I am planning to supervise students on "data science in digital humanities" topics only. Required hard skills: Good level of Python knowledge, interest in natural language modeling and digital humanities. Required soft skills: Being hard working, having excellent communication skills, ability to complete tasks on time, collaboration, work ethic, curiosity and imagination.
