 

ðŸŒ¿   Hi!..This is GÃ¼l Ä°nan.   
- I am a PhD level statistician and working as a faculty member 
at Department of Mathematics, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey. 
- I am currently interested in:
   - Analysis of high-dimensional image data and 
   - Data science tools in digital humanites, and studying in these areas with my students.
- In Spring21, I am teaching an undergraduate level "Introduction to Data Science" course with `R` and using `GitHub classroom` for my class.

- Note 1: I am looking for international/national PhD level collaborators to work on mathematical aspects of deep learning algorithms.
- Note 2: I am not accepting undergraduate students this semester any more, and hoping that there will be an opening for a graduate student in summer 2021 who would like to work on computational digital humanities. I will make an annoucement around July-August. This project will be suitable for ones who has a mathematical engineering or computer science background.
