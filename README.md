You can find more about me at https://gulinan.github.io/.  


As of February 6, 
Devastation has struck Turkey and Syria with two strong earthquakes causing widespread destruction and affecting the lives of many. In Turkey, over 16.170 lives have been lost and the number is expected to rise. We can make a difference. From donating as much as possible to spreading awareness, every action counts. Swipe left to see the difference your 10 Euros can make and how you can donate. Let's come together to support Turkey and Syria in this time of need.

Please share this to raise awareness on how even as little as 10 euro can make a HUGE difference.
